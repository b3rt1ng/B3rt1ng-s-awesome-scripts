# B3rt1ng's awesome scripts

A collection of the scripts I made for my flipper zero with the [momentum firmware](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware), some features of the JS api are not yet out but accessible through the dev version of the firmware, all the files ending with something like dev.js are subject to that.

## Scripts descriptions
| script | description | Dev |
|------|-----|-----|
| advanced_reverse_shell.js | This script will ask for and IP and a port, ask for a shell type (sh, bash, nc) then ask if it needs to open a terminal, how to hide the action using terminal multiplexers, and if it needs to close the terminal. | no |
|advanced_reverse_shell_dev|this is an updated version of advanced_reverse_shell.js that only run on the dev version of the firmware to make the bad keyboard adapt to it's layout, choosing between qwerty, azerty and mac azerty.|yes|
